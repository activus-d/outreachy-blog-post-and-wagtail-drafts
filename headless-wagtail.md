## All about Headless Wagtail

Headless Wagtail is a variant of Wagtail's content management system (CMS). It gives you more options to incorporate technologies that don't run on Python. 

Headless Wagtail CMS offers developers the ability to create custom front-end applications while still leveraging the powerful content management features of the traditional Wagtail CMS. By decoupling the content management interface from the front-end display, Wagtail can be used as a backend for your front-end applications.
