# Manage documents
You can manage documents such as PDFs from the Documents interface. To access the Documents interface click **Documents** in the Wagtail sidebar. This interface allows you to add documents to and remove documents from Wagtail.

Add documents by clicking **Add documents** at the top right of the documents interface. Search for added documents by entering the title of the document in the search bar. The results automatically update as you type. You can also filter the results by Collection by selecting a collection from the Collection dropdown preceding the documents list. 

Select multiple documents by checking the checkbox on the left side of each document, then use the bulk actions bar at the bottom to perform an action on all selected documents.

If you want to edit a document, click the title of the document. When editing a document you can replace the file associated with that document record. This means you can update documents without having to update the pages they're on. Changing the file changes it on all pages that use the document. You can also change the collection of the document by clicking on the Collection dropdown on the edit page and selecting a new collection of your choice. Add or remove tags using the Tags field on the edit page.

```NOTE
The search documents feature is case sensitive.

> The search documents feature is case sensitive. Discuss with the mentors is this is intentional or needs improvement. Also I couldn't find a way to use the document or add it to an existing page. Discuss with the mentors about how one can do this and document it.
