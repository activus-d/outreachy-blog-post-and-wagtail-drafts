# Manage users and roles
Wagtail allows several users to manage content in the admin interface. These users have roles, which determine the access rights they can exercise.

By default, there are three user roles: 
* administrator 
* moderator
* editor 

However, the user roles in your admin interface might be different from these because Wagtail is highly customizable. If this is the case, contact your web developer or webmaster for more details.

## Administrator
An administrator has the highest level of access to the admin interface. The primary role of an administrator is to add, modify, or remove user profiles. As an administrator, you can add, modify, and remove users via the Users interface. To access the Users interface, navigate to **Settings > Users** from the Wagtail **sidebar**.

In the user interface, you can see all of your users, their usernames, roles, and status. The status of a user can either be active or inactive. You can sort this listing either by Name or Username.

Select multiple users by checking the checkbox to the left of each user, then use the bulk action bar at the bottom to perform an action on all selected users.

Clicking on a userâ€™s name opens their profile. From here, you can then edit that user's details.

Additionally, an administrator can create drafts and publish them.

## Moderator
A moderator has the next level of access after an administrator. A moderator has access to creating drafts and publishing them. However, a moderator can't access the **Settings** section of the admin interface.

## Editor
An editor has the least level of access to the admin interface. An editor can only create drafts but not publish them. Also, as in the case of a moderator, an editor can't access the **Settings** section of the admin interface.
