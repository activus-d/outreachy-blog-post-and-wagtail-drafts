# Manage snippets
Snippets allow you to create elements on a website once and reuse them in multiple places. You only have to change something in a snippet once, and the changes appear in all occurrences.

The use of snippets varies between websites. Torchbox has used snippets on some client websites for the following purposes:

* For staff contact information. As a result, you can add them to multiple pages and manage them from one place.
* For adverts. This way, you can apply them sitewide or on individual pages.
* To manage links in a global area of the site. For example, in the footer.
* For calls to action, such as newsletter sign-up blocks, that may be consistent across many different pages.

## The Snippets menu
You can access the Snippets menu by clicking **Snippets** in the Wagtail **Sidebar**. Clicking Snippets takes you to the **Snippets interface**. To add, edit, or delete a snippet, click the snippet type that interests you. Clicking the snippet type takes you to the edit screen from which you can add, edit, or delete a snippet. Hovering over an individual snippet displays the options to edit or delete that snippet. To add a new snippet to the snippet type click **Add (snippet type)**.

If you want to delete multiple snippets at once, select one or more snippets with the checkbox on the left and then click Delete.

```Warning
Editing a snippet changes it on all of the pages on which it is on. In the top-right of the Snippet edit screen, you can see a label saying how many times you have used the snippet. Clicking this label displays a listing of all of these pages.
```

## Add snippets while editing a page
When editing a page, you may find yourself in need of a new snippet. Don't worry, Wagtail has this covered. You can create a new one without leaving the page you are editing.

While editing the page, open the snippets interface in a new tab by Ctrl+click in Windows or cmd+click in MacOS. You can also open a new tab by right-clicking it and then selecting the **Open in new tab** option. Add the new snippet from this new tab as you normally would. Then return to your existing tab and reopen the Snippet chooser window by clicking Snippets from the Wagtail **Sidebar**. Congratulation, you can now see your new snippet, even though you didnâ€™t leave the edit page.

```Note
Even though this is possible, it is advisable to save your page as a draft as often as possible. This prevents you from accidentally exiting the edit page and losing your changes.
