# Managing revisions
Wagtail allows you to retrieve the version of the content you previously saved as a draft or published. You can do this by hovering over a page on the Explorer page and clicking More from the resulting dropdown options. Alternatively, you can access the page history from the top-right corner when editing a page.

On the page history screen, you can see all the actions previously done on that particular page and the users that carried out the actions. Also, you can see the date or time that the action occurred.

On the page history screen, you can also search for specific versions of your content using the filter feature

If you want to compare different draft versions, hover over the draft and click **Compare with previous version** or **Compare with current version**.

To replace the current version of the draft with a previous version, hover over the preferred version of your draft on the page history screen and click **Review this version**. Then click **Replace current version** located at the bottom of the screen. This action logs as a _Revert_ action and you can always go back to review it.


```Note
Discuss with mentors whether to change the title to _Manage page history_ since the term revision is not stated as an official name in the admin interface.
