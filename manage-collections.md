# Manage collections
You can control access to specific sets of images and documents by setting up "collections". By default, all images and documents belong to the "root" collection, but users with appropriate permissions can create new collections by selecting **Settings > Collections** from the Wagtail **Sidebar**.

## Add a collection
To create a collection, click **Add a collection** from the Collections interface. Then enter a name in the **Name** field and select a parent. Click **Create** to complete the creation process.

## Add images or documents to a collection
To add images to a collection, click **Images** from the Wagtail sidebar and select a collection from the **Collections** dropdown. Then click **Add an image** and follow the instructions on the screen.

The process of adding documents to a collection is similar to that of images. click **Documents** from the Wagtail sidebar and select a collection from the **Collections** dropdown. Then click **Add a document** and follow the instructions on the screen.

You can also select a collection as part of uploading multiple images or documents. It's also possible to add an image or document to a collection while editing them. To do this, click **Images** or **Documents** from the Wagtail Sidebar and select the image or document you want to add to a collection by clicking it.

## Privacy settings
To set permissions determining who is able to view documents within a collection, navigate to **Settings > Collections** and select a collection. Then click **Privacy** preceding the collection name. Clicking **Privacy** gives you a pop-up modal from which you select the level of privacy for the collection.

The permissions set on a collection apply to all collections below it in the hierarchy. Therefore, if you make the "root" collection private, all documents on the site become private. Permissions set in other collections only apply to those collections.

```Note
Privacy settings added to a collection are only enforced for documents within the collection. Privacy settings do not apply to images.
