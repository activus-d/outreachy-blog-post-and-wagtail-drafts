# The current state of the user guide
The Wagtail user guide documentation is the primary source of information for editors, moderators, and administrators of Wagtail websites. These roles don't require any prior technical knowledge. Due to this, the user guide documentation must be simple, accurate, complete, and easy to navigate.

## The issue of structure
The structure of the user guide documentation follows the principles encouraged by the Diataxis framework. While this is a step in the right direction, strict adherence to the principles raises some concerns.

The writers of the user guide documentation should see the Diataxis framework as a guide with flexible principles. The writers should apply the principles based on the subjective needs and purpose of the documentation. For instance, the audience and purpose of API documentation are different from those of programming language documentation. The documentation should reflect these differences, however small they may be.

In the case of the Wagtail user guide documentation, it's safer to assume that most of the users of the user guide documentation may not have any technical background. Hence, the writers of the user guide should give priority to the arrangement of the main sections and also the words used as their titles. For instance, it would be a great idea to replace the title `Tutorial` with `Getting started`, `Explanation` with `Concepts`, and `How-to` with `How-to guides`. 

It would also be great to have the `Concepts` section before the `How-to guides` section. This way, new users of the documentation can get used to the technical language used to describe the features of the Admin interface before learning how to use them.

## The issue of inconsistency with the writing style
The existing content of the user guide is great and easy to understand. However, they seem to be scattered across the pages.

One way to improve this is to adopt and implement a writing style to bring about consistency in the tone, language, and grammar of the user guide documentation.

## The issue of undocumented Wagtail features
The user guide documentation needs to include the new features added to the Admin interface. This is essential in promoting Wagtail's capabilities.
