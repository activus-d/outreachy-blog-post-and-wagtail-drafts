## Getting started
* Overview
* Quick tutorial (review with mentors as to whether title is appropriate)

> There should be a discussion regarding the subsection `Quick tutorial`. The discussion will be on how I can create a `Bakerydemo` tutorial from the start to the end. This tutorial does not need to have as many pages as the `Bakerydemo`. However, it should be complete enough to convince a user new to Wagtail about the capabilities of the Wagtail admin interface. The tutorial should take into consideration the following details:
> * The tutorial should state what the end goal is from the beginning. This is to prepare the mind of the user that they're building towards a goal.
> * The tutorial should have clear and orderly steps that a beginner would have to take to get to a meaningful end.
> * The tutorial should state the effect of each step it directs the user to take.
> * Every step in the tutorial should be rewarding. This means that the user should be able to see the effect of each step they take.
> * The tutorial should disclose information progressively.
> * The aim of the tutorial isn't to teach the user about any feature of the Wagtail admin interface but to provide them with a picture of the capabilities of Wagtailâ€™s admin interface.
> * The tutorial has to be complete. You should not be misunderstand this to mean that the tutorial should have all the features of the admin interface. It should be complete in the sense that it has a start that is meaningful to a beginner and a meaningful end.

> ### Possible issue
> The users of the admin interface may not be programmers and the user may not be working on a deployed Wagtail. The instructions on how to work with the `Bakerydemo` within a development environment have to be simplified. One way to avoid complications by users who are not programmers is avoiding the use of a virtual environment and documenting how to work on the `Bakerydemo` with `Gitpod`.

## Concepts

* Reports
  * Locked pages
  * Site history
  * Aging pages

* Locales
* Styleguide
* Multi sites
* ModelAdmin
* Table block
* Supercharged
* Server error

```Note
According to Storm, "ModelAdmin "is similar to "Snippets". The likely long time goal  
is to have the former replaced with the latter.  
If this is the case it may be a good idea to leave "ModelAdmin" out of the How-to  
guides so as to promote the use of "Snippets".  
Having it in the concept section might be great for users who may find it very important.

## How-to guides

* Find your way around
  * The wagtail dashboard
    * How to reach the dashboard (review as it is not parallel in structure with subsequent headings)
    * The Wagtail dashboard panels
    * The Wagtail explorer pages
    * The Wagtail sidebar
    * Search Wagtail
    * Adjust Wagtail's settings
    * Get help

```Note
I do not see any difference between "The wagtail sidebar" and "The sidebar" as used in the  
existing user guide document. My suggestion is to merge the content of both elements into one.

It appears to me that the commands, Search, Pages, Images, Documents, reports, Snippets, and  
Forms are not needed in this subsection. Our focus should be on documenting them in the light  
of their functionality and not as UI elements. I believe mentioning them in the content for  
Sidebar to aid in locating them and as a way to introduce them to the user may be a better  
idea. The best section to host these commands is the Explanation or Concepts section.

The item "Reordering pages" in the existing user guide document would find a better use and  
purpose an item in `Manage pages`. This means it should be on the same level as 
"Finding your way around".
