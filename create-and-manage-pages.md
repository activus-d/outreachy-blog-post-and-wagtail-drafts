## Create new pages
To create a new page, click `...` Actions and select the Add child page option. This creates a child page of the section you are currently in. In this case a child page of the 'Breads' page.

## Edit existing pages
You can access an existing page's edit screen in three ways. First by clicking Actions and then selecting the Edit option from the dropdown. Second, by clicking the page's title if you are accessing the page from its parent's Explorer page or in search results. Last, if you are accessing the page from the Explorer page of its parent, you can hover over the page and then click Edit.

On the edit screen, you can find the title of the page you are editing at the top of the page. If the page is already published, then you can find a link to the live version of the page at the top right of the page. To change the title of the page, click the title field and enter a new title. 

While on the edit screen, you can perform several actions, such as copying, moving, or deleting a page. To perform any of these actions, click Actions at the top of the edit screen and select the applicable option from the dropdown.

## Create and edit comments
To toggle on commenting mode, click Comments at the top of the edit screen page. Once commenting mode is on, you can create a new comment or reply to a comment by hovering over any commentable field to reveal the add comment icon.

If there is no pre-existing comment in the field, click the add comment icon to create a new comment. However, if there is an existing comment, clicking either the field button or the comment brings the comment thread into focus. This allows you to add new replies.

To comment on the text within the rich text field, highlight the text and then click the add comment icon to add an inline comment.

Alternatively, you can perform all of these actions using the comment shortcut, Ctrl + Alt + M / âŒ˜ + Alt + M.

To edit, delete or resolve a comment, click the three vertical dots in the top right of an existing comment and select the applicable option. Saving the page after leaving a comment or replying to a comment saves the comment or reply.

> Open an issue for adding a tooltip for the `add comment` action on the edit screen. Once this is done, modify `Edit existing page` by replacing `clicking the add comment icon` with `clicking the add comment`. [UI elements and interaction](https://developers.google.com/style/ui-elements).
