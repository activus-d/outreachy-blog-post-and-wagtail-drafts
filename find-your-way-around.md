# Find your way around
This section describes the different pages that you are going to see as you navigate around the CMS, and how you can find the content that you are looking for.

## The dashboard
The Wagtail **Dashboard** is the main hub of a Wagtail website. From the dashboard, you can access all of the content you create in Wagtail as well as reports, settings, and other content management features.

If you access a new version of Wagtail for the first time, your **Dashboard** shows a banner notifying you of the changes to Wagtail. The banner has a link to the Editor guide where you can learn more about these changes.

Now let's walk you through the different panels and features you are going to find in the dashboard.

```Note
What you see in your Wagtail **Dashboard** depends on your user role. Common user roles include editors, moderators, and administrators.

Wagtail is highly customizable, so your Wagtail **Dashboard** may look different from the one we are using in this demonstration. We are using the Wagtail Bakery for demonstration purposes. If you have trouble locating a panel or feature, you may want to ask your webmaster or developer if they added any customizations.

### How to reach the dashboard
Logging into Wagtail automatically takes you to the **Dashboard**. If you navigate away from the dashboard, you can return to it at any time by clicking on the Wagtail logo in the top-left section of your screen.

### The dashboard panels
The dashboard panels gives you an overview of the different states of your Wagtail pages. The different panels in your Wagtail dashboard are as follows:

#### Your pages in a workflow
The _Your pages in a workflow_ panel shows you any pages in moderation that you own or submitted for moderation yourself. It also shows the moderation tasks that are pending and how long the tasks have been open.

#### Awaiting your review
If your webmaster or web developer gives you permission to perform moderation actions, your Wagtail dashboard displays the _Awaiting your review panel_. This panel shows content that's ready for you to review.

From the panel, you can perform the following actions:
* Click the name of a page to edit that page.
* Use the buttons to move the page to the next stage in your workflow by requesting changes to a page, approving the page, or approve the page with a comment.
* Get a quick view of the page status by hovering over the indicator circles to get more information about the pending task. The indicator circles show a tick for a completed task or an empty circle for an incomplete one.
* See how long a page has been waiting for review.

#### Your most recent edits
The panel _Your most recent edits_ displays the five pages you last edited. The panel also shows the date that you last edited the pages as well as the current status of the pages.

#### Your locked pages
The _Your locked pages panel_ shows all of the pages you've locked so that only you can edit them. From this panel, you can quickly view the date you locked a page. To edit a locked page, click the name.

### The Wagtail explorer pages
The Explorer page allows you to view a pageâ€™s children and perform actions on them. In the Explorer page, you can publish and unpublish pages, move them to other sections, drill down into the content tree, or reorder pages within a parent to appear in menus.

### The Wagtail sidebar
On the left hand side of the dashboard and throughout Wagtail is a menu called the Wagtail **Sidebar**. You can use the Sidebar to navigate to different parts of Wagtail.

The Wagtail **Sidebar** helps you quickly access your content as well as Wagtail features and settings. The items on the **Sidebar** can vary depending on what your developer or webmaster decides to give you access to. A standard Wagtail installation has the main Wagtail features in the sidebar. These features include, Search, Documents, Snippets, Forms, Reports, Settings, and Help.

### Search Wagtail
The search feature is the topmost feature in the Wagtail **Sidebar**. You can use the search feature to quickly search for content in Wagtail.

### Adjust Wagtail's settings
Click **Settings** from the Wagtail sidebar to access Wagtail settings. If you have the correct role, you'll be able to add users, add user groups, and perform other administrative tasks.

### Get help
Click **Help** from the Wagtail sidebar to access links to the user documentation and new features of the latest version of Wagtail.


> I noticed that the document used the terms `tools` and `features` interchangeably. To bring about consistency in this in terms, I have decided to go with the term `features`. The reason for this is that I belive the term `features` can be used more broadly to cover for both the wagtail tools and the other components that may not be strictly regarded as tools.
> I also think using the term `toolbar` is confusing since it basically the same as the `sidebar`. In this draft, I  substitute the term `toolbar` with `sidebar` to avoid confusing the user.
